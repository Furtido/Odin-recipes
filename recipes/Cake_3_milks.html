                <p>The tres leches cake(Milk cake) is one of the most popular sweets in Venezuela, although several countries dispute its creation. 
                    It is common for them to be offered in restaurants and candy stores, both professional and artisanal. 
                    But why is it called 3 milks cake and what does it consist of to be so famous?
                    Basically, it is a sponge cake soaked in a mixture of three dairy products: heavy cream, 
                    evaporated milk and condensed milk. As you can see, it is a very moist sweet with a slight flavor of vanilla or lemon zest.

            </div>
            <div class="box-ol">
                <ol>
                    <li> Heat oven to 375°F. Butter 9”x13” baking pan. Dust pan with flour, tapping out excess; set aside. 
                        In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour and baking powder; set aside. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Crack 6 egg whites into a large bowl; reserve yolks. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until frothy. Gradually add 1 
                        cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Add 6 egg yolks, one at a time, mixing until incorporated. 
                        Alternately beat in flour mixture and milk to egg mixture, starting and ending with flour mixture. Stir in vanilla. Pour cake batter 
                        into prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30 – 35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes and poke holes into cake using 
                        a 2-pronged meat fork.
                    </li>
                    <li> Meanwhile, pour condensed milk, evaporated milk and heavy cream into a bowl. Transfer half of the liquid to a small saucepan. 
                        Bring milk mixture to a boil; remove from heat and stir in remaining mixture. Pour milk slowly over cake until absorbed; 
                        cover and transfer to the refrigerator; chill 1 hour.
                    </li>
                    <li> Meanwhile, in bowl of double boiler, using a whisk, beat 3 egg whites until frothy. Gradually add remaining sugar. Continue beating until 
                        stiff-peaks form and meringue is shiny, about 5 minutes. Whisk in lime juice. Spread meringue over top of cake. 
                        Store leftovers (if any) in refrigerator.
