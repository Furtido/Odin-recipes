    <img src="../images/fried.webp">
    <p>The best potatoes for French fries are soaked in a sugar solution before frying. <br>
        The sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates and prevents the potatoes from soaking up a lot of grease, so they get crunchy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>â…“ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large russet potatoes - peeled, and sliced into 1/4 inch strips</li>
        <li>6 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
